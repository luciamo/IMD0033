Every time Hollywood releases a movie, critics from **Metacritic**, **Fandango**, **Rotten Tomatoes**, and **IMDB** review and rate the film. They also ask the users in their respective communities to review and rate the film. Then, they calculate the average rating from both critics and users and display them on their site.

    "By default, matplotlib uses the minimal ranges for the data limits necessary to display all of the data we specify. By manually setting the data limits ranges to specific ranges for all plots, we're ensuring that we can accurately compare. We can even use the methods we just mentioned to zoom in on a part of the plots. For example, the following code will constrained the axes to the **4** to **5** range:\n",

    "From the scatter plots, we can conclude that user ratings from IMDB and Fandango are the most similar. In addition, user ratings from Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes have positive but weak correlations with user ratings from Fandango. We can also notice that user ratings from Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes span a larger range of values than those from IMDB or Fandango. User ratings from Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes range from 1 to 5. User ratings from Fandango range approximately from 2.5 to 5 while those from IMDB range approximately from 2 to 4.5.\n",

    "The scatter plots unfortunately only give us a cursory understanding of the distributions of user ratings from each review site. For example, if a hundred movies had the same average user rating from IMDB and Fandango in the dataset, we would only see a single marker in the scatter plot. In the next mission, we'll learn about two types of plots that help us understand distributions of values."
